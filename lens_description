Lens

A lightweight thinking tool for clearer perspectives

Lens is a minimal Chrome extension designed to help you see situations more clearly — without telling you what to do.

It does not offer advice, predictions, or decisions.
Instead, it presents a carefully designed lens — a neutral principle and a small set of reflective prompts — to help you reframe what you’re facing.

Open it, read, reflect, and close it.
Most sessions take less than 30 seconds.

⸻

What Lens is (and isn’t)

Lens is not:
	•	A decision-making engine
	•	A productivity system
	•	A therapy substitute
	•	A political or ideological tool
	•	An AI that tells you what the answer is

Lens is:
	•	A perspective-shifting tool
	•	A way to slow down reactive thinking
	•	A structured prompt for reflection
	•	A companion for moments of uncertainty

It helps you ask better questions — not receive final answers.

⸻

How it works

Each time you open Lens, you are shown one carefully written lens:
	•	A neutral principle
A concise observation about how complex situations often work.
	•	Reflective prompts
One or two questions that invite you to examine your situation from that angle.
	•	A counter-question
A reminder that no single perspective is complete.

You may optionally write a single sentence describing your situation, but Lens never analyzes or judges it.
The text stays on your device and is only there to help you focus.

There are no long sessions, no feeds, and no pressure to engage.
Lens is designed to be opened, used briefly, and closed.

⸻

Why Lens exists

When people feel stuck, they often don’t lack information — they lack perspective.

Most tools try to solve this by:
	•	Giving advice
	•	Offering optimization strategies
	•	Automating decisions
	•	Or replacing thinking with “answers”

Lens takes a different approach.

It assumes that:
	•	Many problems are complex, not solvable by a single rule
	•	Clarity often comes from reframing, not deciding
	•	The right question can be more useful than a quick answer

Lens exists to create a small pause — a moment where you can look at your situation through a different lens.

⸻

Design principles

Lens is built around a few simple ideas:

1. Perspectives, not prescriptions

Lens never tells you what you should do.
Its language avoids absolutes, commands, and moral judgments.

2. Minimal friction

No accounts.
No setup.
No data syncing.

Just open and reflect.

3. Neutral by design

The principles are intentionally written to avoid political, ideological, or cultural positioning.
They focus on patterns, trade-offs, and structure rather than conclusions.

4. Respect for the user

Your situation belongs to you.
Lens does not store it, analyze it remotely, or turn it into data.

⸻

What you’ll find inside

Lens includes a curated set of reflection lenses covering areas such as:
	•	Decisions and trade-offs
	•	Uncertainty and timing
	•	Constraints and leverage
	•	Patterns and systems
	•	Values, risk, and reversibility

Each lens is designed to stand on its own.
You don’t need to read them in order or “complete” anything.

⸻

Typical moments to use Lens

People often open Lens when:
	•	A decision feels heavier than it should
	•	A situation feels urgent but unclear
	•	They’re looping on the same thoughts
	•	They want to step back before acting
	•	They need a calmer way to think

Lens is not meant for constant use.
It’s meant for moments.

⸻

Privacy & simplicity

Lens works entirely on your device.
	•	No accounts
	•	No tracking
	•	No cloud processing
	•	No behavioral profiling

Your input, if any, stays local and is never sent anywhere.

⸻

About AI

Lens does not rely on large language models to generate advice or decisions.

If AI is introduced in future versions, it will be used only to:
	•	Rephrase your own words more clearly
	•	Surface relevant lenses
	•	Generate reflective questions

It will not:
	•	Make recommendations
	•	Replace your judgment
	•	Act as an authority

The goal is always the same: clearer thinking, not outsourced thinking.

⸻

Who Lens is for

Lens is for people who:
	•	Value independent thinking
	•	Prefer tools over opinions
	•	Want clarity without noise
	•	Are tired of being told what to do

It’s especially useful for:
	•	Knowledge workers
	•	Designers and engineers
	•	Founders and operators
	•	Anyone navigating complex choices

⸻

A note on answers

Lens is sometimes described as an “answer book,” but that’s misleading.

It does not contain answers.
It contains ways of looking.

And sometimes, that’s enough.

⸻

One last thing

Lens is intentionally small.

It does not try to hold your attention or keep you engaged.
It exists to give you a brief moment of clarity — and then step out of the way.

This tool offers perspectives, not decisions.
